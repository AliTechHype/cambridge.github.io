## ðŸ’° Business Logic Implementation

### Profit/Loss Calculation
The system now calculates profit/loss using the following formula:

```
Profit/Loss = (Selling Price - Total Cost Per Unit) Ã— Quantity - Credits + Expenses
```

Where:
- **Total Cost Per Unit** = (Total Investment + Additional Charges) Ã· Quantity
- **Credits**: Amount given as credit to client (reduces profit)
- **Expenses**: Additional costs incurred (increases loss)

### Example Scenario
1. **Stock Purchase**: 20 cartons with â‚¹100 investment + â‚¹40 additional charges = â‚¹140 total cost
2. **Sale**: Sell at â‚¹180 per unit
3. **Calculation**: 
   - Total Cost Per Unit = â‚¹140 Ã· 20 = â‚¹7 per unit
   - Profit = (â‚¹180 - â‚¹7) Ã— 20 = â‚¹3,460 profit
   - If credits = â‚¹100 and expenses = â‚¹50
   - Final Profit = â‚¹3,460 - â‚¹100 + â‚¹50 = â‚¹3,410

### Repurchase Handling
- **Repurchase = "Y"**: Indicates this is a repurchase, may affect pricing strategy
- **Repurchase = "N"**: Initial purchase, standard pricing applies
